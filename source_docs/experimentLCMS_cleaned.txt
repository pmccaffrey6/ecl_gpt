ExperimentLCMS[Samples]⟹Protocol

Generates a Protocol to separate and analyze Samples via Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (LCMS).
    
Liquid chromatography - Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) separates samples injected into a liquid flow by passage through an adsorbent column (see ExperimentHPLC). After separation, analytes are ionized, selected, and detected in the Mass Spectrometer device (see ExperimentMassSpectrometry). Within, ions are resolved by their mass versus charge state. Optionally, ions can be fragmented by collision with an inert gas, and the resulting product ions can, in turn, be resolved and detected for more information. In total, LC-MS can answer composition questions; for example, proteins, lipids, and metabolites can be identified in a sample. Furthermore, LC-MS can answer concentration questions; for instance, nucleotides can be quantified in a biological sample.

Example Function Calls

    Basics

        High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) separates sample mixtures into analyzable molecular constituents by injection into flowing liquid that passes through a retentive column:
        ExperimentLCMS[mySamples]

    MassAnalyzer
        Use the MassAnalyzer option to select TripleQuadruploe as the mass analyzer
        ExperimentLCMS[mySamples,
            MassAnalyzer -> TripleQuadruploe,
            ConeGasFlow -> (90 * PSI)
        ]

    Separation Mode and Gradient
        More specific buffers and gradient profiles can also be articulated. For example:

        ExperimentLCMS[mySamples,
            BufferB -> Model[Sample, "Methanol - LCMS grade"],
            GradientB -> {
                {0 * Minute, 5 * Percent},
                {20 * Minute, 40 * Percent}
            }
        ]
        A full gradient table can be specified:
        ExperimentLCMS[mySamples,
            Gradient -> {
                {0 * Minute, 95 * Percent, 5 * Percent, 0 * Percent, 
            0 * Percent, (1 * Milliliter) / Minute},
                {15 * Minute, 50 * Percent, 50 * Percent, 0 * Percent, 
            0 * Percent, (1 * Milliliter) / Minute},
                {30 * Minute, 5 * Percent, 95 * Percent, 0 * Percent, 
            0 * Percent, (1 * Milliliter) / Minute}
            }
        ]

    Ionization
        The polarity of the ions analyzed can be set along with the desired reference solution for the sample masses:
        ExperimentLCMS[mySamples,
            IonMode -> Positive,
            Calibrant -> 
        Model[Sample, StockSolution, Standard, "Cesium Iodide ESI Calibrant"]
        ]

        Specific settings for electrospray ionization source can be controlled in order to maximize ionization capability:
        ExperimentLCMS[mySamples,
            ESICapillaryVoltage -> (1 * Kilovolt),
            ConeGasFlow -> ((300 * Liter) / Hour)
        ]

    Acquisition Windows and Modes
        Different acquisition modes can be specified within different time periods for the same chromatogram. Here, for all of the samples, during the time period from 2 minutes to 5 minutes, an MS1FullScan acquisition is employed (no fragmentation; measure intact ions). From 7 minutes to 9, a data dependent acquisition is performed (see the appropriate section above):
        ExperimentLCMS[mySamples,
            AcquisitionWindow -> {
                Span[2 * Minute, 5 * Minute],
                Span[7 * Minute, 9 * Minute]
            },
            AcquisitionMode -> {MS1FullScan, DataDependent}
        ]

        Similarly, different fragmentation instructions can be specified for different time periods:
        ExperimentLCMS[mySamples,
            AcquisitionWindow -> {
                Span[2 * Minute, 5 * Minute],
                Span[7 * Minute, 9 * Minute]
            },
            Fragment -> {True, False},
            MassDetection -> {(650 * Gram) / Mole, Protein},
            FragmentMassDetection -> {
                Span[(300 * Gram) / Mole, (1000 * Gram) / Mole],
                Null
            }
        ]

                        Span[7 * Minute, 9 * Minute]

                        ]
                    },
                {
                        {

                {
                        {
                            (174.1 * Gram) / Mole,
                            (195. * Gram) / Mole,
                            (397.1 * Gram) / Mole,
                            (448.2 * Gram) / Mole
                        }
                    }
            }
        ]

        Specified MassAnalyzer, AcquisitionMode and MultipleReactionMonitoringAssays to conduct multiple reaction monitoring analysis by using QTRAP 6500:

        ExperimentLCMS[mySamples,
            AcquisitionMode -> {{MultipleReactionMonitoring}},
            MassAnalyzer -> TripleQuadrupole,
            MultipleReactionMonitoringAssays -> {
                {
                        {
                            Quantity[356, "Grams" / "Moles"],
                            Quantity[30, "Volts"],

                            Quantity[4, "Seconds"]
                        },
                        {
                            Quantity[456, "Grams" / "Moles"],
                            Quantity[40, "Volts"],
                            Quantity[345, "Grams" / "Moles"],
                            Quantity[2, "Seconds"]
                        },
                        {
                            Quantity[453, "Grams" / "Moles"],
                            Quantity[65, "Volts"],
                            Quantity[345, "Grams" / "Moles"],
                            Quantity[3, "Seconds"]
                        },
                        {
                            Quantity[764, "Grams" / "Moles"],
                            Quantity[30, "Volts"],
                            Quantity[345, "Grams" / "Moles"],
                            Quantity[2, "Seconds"]
                        }
                    }
            }
        ]

    Data Dependent Acquisition
        In data dependent acquisition, the measurement is split into cycles (see the figure above). In the first part of the cycle, the intact ions (no fragmentations) are surveyed and considered for fragmentation analysis:

        ExperimentLCMS[mySamples,
            AcquisitionMode -> DataDependent,
            AcquisitionSurvey -> 20
        ]
        A threshold can be specified on whether to consider an intact ion for fragmentation analysis. Likewise, a limit can be placed so that a highly abundant ion is not overly analyzed:

        ExperimentLCMS[mySamples,
            AcquisitionMode -> DataDependent,
            MinimumThreshold -> (100000 * ArbitraryUnit),
            AcquisitionLimit -> (2000000 * ArbitraryUnit)
        ]

        Various m/z can be excluded from the acquisition program:
        ExperimentLCMS[mySamples,
            AcquisitionMode -> DataDependent,
            ExclusionMass -> {
                {All, (656 * Gram) / Mole},
                {All, (657 * Gram) / Mole}
            }
        ]

        Masses can be prioritized for fragmentation as they surface during the surveys:
        ExperimentLCMS[mySamples,
            AcquisitionMode -> DataDependent,
            InclusionMass -> {
                {Preferential, (987 * Gram) / Mole},
                {Preferential, (1013 * Gram) / Mole}
            }
        ]

        Masses can be prioritized for fragmentation as they surface during the surveys:

        ExperimentLCMS[mySamples,
            AcquisitionMode -> DataDependent,
            InclusionMass -> {
                {Preferential, (987 * Gram) / Mole},
                {Preferential, (1013 * Gram) / Mole}
            }
        ]

        Redundant isotopes can excluded from acquisition surveys:
        ExperimentLCMS[mySamples, SurveyIsotopeExclusion -> True]

        Redundant charge states can excluded from acquisition surveys:
        ExperimentLCMS[mySamples, SurveyChargeStateExclusion -> True]

    Standards and Blanks
        ExperimentLCMS can be used to quantify analytes in a sample, in which case, a Standard sample is employed to serve as reference. A standard can be submitted before and after the injection sequence of the samples simply by running:
        ExperimentLCMS[mySamples, StandardFrequency -> FirstAndLast]

        Likewise, a Blank sample can be used to see if there is any background from the injection process. To run a blank to occur between every 5 samples, use the following command:
        ExperimentLCMS[mySamples, BlankFrequency -> 5]

    PhotoDiodeArray detection
        PhotoDiodeArray detection involves passes light across a range of wavelengths and measures how much light is absorbed for each even wavelength:
        ExperimentLCMS[mySamples,
            AbsorbanceWavelength -> Span[400, 500 * Nanometer],
            UVFilter -> True
        ]

    Injection Table
        In addition to specifying frequencies of running standards and blanks, now the injection sequence of samples, standards, blanks, and column primes/flushes can be explicitly articulated as well. In this case, an additional column flush is specified after the injection of the second sample:
        customInjectionTable = customInjectionTable = {
                {ColumnPrime, Null, Null, myGradientMethod1, 
            myMassAcquisitionMethod1},
                {Sample, mySample1, 2 * Microliter, myGradientMethod2, 
            myMassAcquisitionMethod2},
                {Blank, myBlank1, 5 * Microliter, myGradientMethod2, 
            myMassAcquisitionMethod2},
                {Sample, mySample2, 3 * Microliter, myGradientMethod2, 
            myMassAcquisitionMethod2},
                {ColumnFlush, Null, Null, myGradientMethod1, 
            myMassAcquisitionMethod1},
                {Standard, myStandard1, 2 * Microliter, myGradientMethod2, 
            myMassAcquisitionMethod2},
                {Sample, mySample3, 5 * Microliter, myGradientMethod2, 
            myMassAcquisitionMethod2},
                {ColumnFlush, Null, Null, myGradientMethod1, 
            myMassAcquisitionMethod1}
            };
        ExperimentLCMS[{mySample1, mySample2, mySample3},
            InjectionTable -> customInjectionTable
        ]

ESICapillaryVoltage
The absolute voltage applied to the tip of the stainless steel capillary tubing in order to produce charged droplets. Adjust this voltage to maximize sensitivity. Most compounds are optimized between 0.5 and 3.2 kV in ESI positive ion mode and 0.5 and 2.6 in ESI negative ion mode, but can be altered according to sample type. For low flow applications, best sensitivity will be achieved with a relatively high value in ESI positive (e.g. 3.0 kV), for standard flow UPLC a value of 0.5 kV is typically best for maximum sensitivity.
Default Value: Automatic
Default Calculation: Is automatically set according to the flow rate (0-0.02 ml/min -> 3.0 kV, 0.02-0.1 ml/min -> 1.5 kV, >0.1 ml/min -> 0.5 kV).

This voltage attracts charged ions in the spray being produced from the capillary tip into the ion block leading into the mass spectrometer. This voltage is typically set to 25-100 V and its tuning has little effect on sensitivity compared to other options (e.g. StepwaveVoltage).
Default Value: Automatic
Default Calculation: Is automatically set to any specified MassAcquisition method; otherwise, set to 40 Volt.
Pattern Description: Greater than or equal to 0.1 volts and less than or equal to 150 volts.

Index Matches to: experiment samples
StepwaveVoltage
The voltage offset between the 1st and 2nd stage of the ion guide which leads ions coming from the sample cone towards the quadrupole mass analyzer. This voltage normally optimizes between 25 and 150 V and should be adjusted for sensitivity depending on compound and charge state. For multiply charged species it is typically set to to 40-50 V, and higher for singly charged species. In general higher cone voltages (120-150 V) are needed for larger mass ions such as intact proteins and monoclonal antibodies. It also has greatest effect on in-source fragmentation and should be decreased if in-source fragmentation is observed but not desired. This is an unique option for QTOF as the massanalyzer.
Default Value: Automatic

BlankStepwaveVoltage
The voltage offset between the 1st and 2nd stage of the stepwave ion guide which leads ions coming from the sample cone towards the quadrupole mass analyzer. This voltage normally optimizes between 25 and 150 V and should be adjusted for sensitivity depending on compound and charge state. For multiply charged species it is typically set to to 40-50 V, and higher for singly charged species. In general higher cone voltages (120-150 V) are needed for larger mass ions such as intact proteins and monoclonal antibodies. It also has greatest effect on in-source fragmentation and should be decreased if in-source fragmentation is observed but not desired.
